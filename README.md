#### Description:
As the developer behind this semi-banking system application, I drew inspiration from finance apps that have become indispensable in managing personal finances. My goal in creating this application was to offer users essential banking features in a secure and user-friendly way, while also adding some unique constraints to enhance security and promote responsible financial behavior. The application allows users to perform critical functions such as withdrawing, depositing, transferring money, viewing transaction histories, and changing their account passwords. However, I wanted to go beyond simply offering these basic functionalities by introducing a layer of control and oversight that would make the system more structured and reliable.

One of the most important design choices I made was to require the creation of a moderator account before any user accounts could be set up. This may seem like an unusual step, but it serves an essential purpose. In many systems, having an administrative or moderator account ensures that someone is always responsible for overseeing the platform and ensuring that it functions correctly. In this case, the moderator account acts as a gatekeeper for the system. Without this account in place, no other users can register or log in. This creates a safeguard against unauthorized access and also ensures that the system has a central authority figure in charge of user management. I felt that this was a crucial aspect of the system, as it provides a level of oversight and control similar to what you'd find in more traditional banking environments.

Once the moderator account is set up, users can proceed to create their own accounts. However, even this process includes some important checks to maintain security and prevent errors. For example, each user must select a unique username. I added a check during the account creation process to ensure that no two users can have the same username. This might seem like a small detail, but it’s vital for ensuring that all transactions are properly routed to the correct accounts. After all, if two users were allowed to have the same username, it could lead to serious issues when transferring money or viewing transaction histories. By enforcing unique usernames, I made sure that each user has a clear and distinct identity within the system.

Now, once users have their accounts set up, they can start using the application’s banking features. Let me walk you through each of these functionalities and the thought process behind them. First, the **withdrawal** feature allows users to withdraw money from their accounts, but I wanted to make sure that people didn’t drain their accounts completely. So, I set up a rule where users can only withdraw up to 99,999,999.00 in a single transaction. Additionally, I added a condition that requires users to leave at least 100 in their accounts after the withdrawal. This ensures that they don’t completely deplete their balance, which could help avoid situations where users find themselves with zero funds left for emergencies or immediate needs. It's a small safeguard, but an important one, I believe, for promoting financial responsibility.

Next is the **deposit** feature, which lets users add money to their accounts. I set a minimum deposit amount of 500, which is a reasonable threshold for ensuring that users make meaningful contributions to their accounts. On the other hand, I also capped deposits at 99,999,999.00, similar to the withdrawal limit. This cap prevents users from depositing unreasonably large amounts in a single transaction, which could overwhelm the system or lead to errors in handling such vast sums. By placing these limits, I aimed to create a balanced system where users could comfortably manage their finances without the risk of overloading the application.

One of the more complex features I implemented is the **money transfer** function, which allows users to send money to others based on their unique usernames. This feature mirrors the way many real-world banking systems work, where you can transfer funds by simply entering the recipient’s details. However, I added several important checks to ensure the process runs smoothly and securely. For instance, before completing a transfer, the system checks whether the recipient’s account would exceed the maximum allowed balance of 99,999,999.00. If the transfer would push the recipient over this limit, the transaction is denied. Similarly, the system checks the sender’s account to ensure they will still have at least 100 left after sending the money. These conditions ensure that both parties are adhering to the system’s rules and prevent situations where users send or receive amounts that could disrupt their account balance.

Of course, financial transparency is crucial in any banking system, which is why I also implemented a **transaction history** feature. Users can view a detailed record of all their past transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. This helps users keep track of their spending and allows them to review any discrepancies. I wanted this feature to be as clear and comprehensive as possible, so users would always have a clear view of their financial activity within the system. It’s a simple but powerful tool for promoting accountability and responsible money management.

Finally, I added the ability for users to **change their account passwords**. In today’s world, where security breaches are an ever-present risk, I felt it was essential to give users the option to update their passwords regularly. This feature helps safeguard user accounts from unauthorized access and reinforces the importance of keeping sensitive information secure. I made sure this process is quick and easy, so users can change their passwords as frequently as they like without hassle.

Looking ahead, I see a lot of potential for improving this system. One area that I’m particularly excited about expanding is the **moderator** role. Right now, the moderator account is primarily a prerequisite for user account creation, but I have plans to give the moderator more control over the system in future versions. For example, the moderator could manage user accounts, approve or reject new account requests, or even set system-wide rules for transactions. I believe these enhancements would make the system more robust and versatile, especially as it scales to accommodate more users.

Additionally, I plan to move this application to the web in a future course, specifically during the **WEB CS50** program. By turning this into a web-based platform, I can make it more accessible and user-friendly. Users would be able to access their accounts from any device with an internet connection, which would significantly increase the system’s usability. Of course, this shift to the web would also require stronger security measures, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, but I’m excited to tackle these challenges in the next phase of development.

In conclusion, developing this semi-banking system has been a rewarding experience. I wanted to create an application that not only provides essential banking services but also encourages users to manage their finances responsibly. Through features like account creation, withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and password management, I believe this system offers a solid foundation for personal financial management. I’m excited to see how the project evolves in the future as I continue to improve its functionality and security.
